  // RULES OF CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
  // Cell states: alive or dead. Game progresses in generations.
  // Next generation cell state depends on eight neighbors:
  //   - Live cell < 2 neighbors dies (underpopulation).
  //   - Live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
  //   - Live cell > 3 neighbors dies (overpopulation).
  //   - Dead cell with 3 neighbors revives (reproduction).
